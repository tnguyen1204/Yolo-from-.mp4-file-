YoloV8n is a model trained by ultralytics, not by myself. The main goal of this model is to analyse the frame with a minimal latency. It is suitable for real time detection. 
Please note that if your goal is to detect in an imported video and your goal is not to use it in realtime operation you might want to change the model.
